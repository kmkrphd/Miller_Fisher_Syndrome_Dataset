# Miller_Fisher_Syndrome_Dataset

The MFS dataset supplies complex and measurable information on the symptoms and diagnostic indicators of the disorder, which is essential for efficient diagnosis and research. The dataset was carefully assembled from several medical institutions; thus, all data collection followed only legal and ethical practices. All participants gave appropriate consent, and the data set was anonymized to protect patients’ privacy. In addition, this information has been obtained and shared in conformity with all applicable healthcare laws. The dataset includes the most essential symptomatic elements such as Age, gender, Prodromal Infection Type, Diplopia Severity, Ophthalmoplegia Severity, Ataxia Severity, Areflexia Severity, Pupillary Abnormalities Severity (PAS), CSF Protein Level (mg/dL), and Positive GQ1b Antibodies (%).
The dataset consists of age and gender distribution of 100 samples. Age is a determinant as symptoms and response to treatment will vary from one age group to the other. Gender distribution is considered due to the slight dominance of males among MFS sufferers. The prodromal infection groups the infection (respiratory or gastrointestinal) as initiated before the symptoms of MFS onset. Knowledge of the prodromal infection may associate certain diseases with the probability of provoking MFS, thus facilitating preventive measures. Diplopia or double vision severity is graded on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). This symptom is a typical early warning sign of MFS, and its severity may be used to determine how the disease advances. Ophthalmoparesis is also graded from 0 to 3. As part of the classic triad of MFS symptoms, the presence and severity of its signs are diagnostic. The scale of ataxia (voluntary control of muscle movements) runs from 0 to 3. Ataxia is a component of the classic triad, and the evaluation further supports the diagnosis. Areflexia Severity is scored from 0 to 3, which indicates the severity of areflexia (lack of reflexes), the third part of the classical triad. Quantifying areflexia can be critical in separating MFS from other neurological disorders. PAS is scored from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) to describe the occurrence and strength of pupillary abnormalities, which may be present in MFS. The elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels in MFS are quite diagnostic of the disease. Offering levels rather than a binary tracker allows more detailed evaluation and tracking through time. GQ1b antibodies percentage, where 0% is used to signify absence, and 100% is used to represent entire presence. The positivity of antibodies against GQ1b (Ganglioside Q1b) is robust evidence of MFS, so this is a significant diagnostic marker.
